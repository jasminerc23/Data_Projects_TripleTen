## Project Task
* Create a project decomposition based on the initial review of Zomato's database. Decide which segment within the datbase you will analyze and create a theory based on your findings. Upon creating a theory draft a visual essay to represent the trends of the customer segment.
## Project Overview
  * Identifying key trends of the customer are significant to understand the success of a business. After identifying that the target demographic, single, male, students, with no income, are using the platform the most, I could identify where the target demographic was eating, where there was room to grow business, and offer suggestions as to where there was room for opportunity using marketing techniques.
