## Project Task
* This is a 5 day competition hosted by Tripleten for students nearing the end of their business intelligence analytics course. Collaboratively students will review 3 datasets, choose 1, and create a theory that best represents their findings. After reviewing the database in Microsoft Excel, students are to use a software of their choice to represent their analytical findings. Each team member is assigned roles and responsibilities to delegate tasks and create functional flow of the project. These roles will help simmulate life as a professional data analyst working on real business cases.
## Summary of Project
* After viewing and cleaning the database in Microsoft Excel, we collaboratively created a theory to represent a real life experience in which most music streaming listeners experienced. Based on data, we created a theory that: the music created and streamed during the time period of 2020-2023 was reflective of the emotions and need for human connectiveness during Covid-19 Pandemic.
