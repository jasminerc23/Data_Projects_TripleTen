## Introduction: 
* Analyze Airbnb's database to identify a profitable neighborhood where a real estate investor can purchase property to establish a short term vacation rental. The client gives a certain set of criteria in which the database is to be analyzed. After analysis offer the client suggestions on where to purchase property using pivot tables in Google Sheets.
## Objective
* By filtering data, creating pivot tables, formulating calculations for occupancy rate, estimating potential revenue, determining popular neighborhoods, identifying popular rental sizes. I will be able to make informed decisions to offer the client who is seeking guidance on identifying the most lucrative investment properties out of the Airbnb database.
