## Introduction: 
* Analyze Airbnb's database to identify a profitable neighborhood where a real estate investor can purchase property to establish a short term vacation rental. The client gives a certain set of criteria in which the database is to be analyzed. After analysis offer the client suggestions on where to purchase property using pivot tables in Google Sheets.
## Objective
* By filtering data, creating pivot tables, formulating calculations for occupancy rate, estimating potential revenue, determining popular neighborhoods, identifying popular rental sizes. I will be able to make informed decisions to offer the client who is seeking guidance on identifying the most lucrative investment properties out of the Airbnb database. 
## Summary of findings: 
* Through careful filtering in cloud based Google Sheets, the criteria set by the client/ investor allows ~70,000 listings to be narrowed down and further analyzed. After filtering down the data, pivot tables are used to extract information which help to identify the top 10 neighborhoods in which renters prefer, how many bedrooms they fruequently rent, the occupany rate of each listing, and price point. The analysis uncovered the Midtown, Manhattan, New York neighborhood as the #1 neighborhood for vacation rentals. The median rental price point of ~$350 will generate a yearly profit of ~$130,000.
