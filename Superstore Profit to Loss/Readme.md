## Summary of Findings

* Geography, time, customer info and sales are key metrics used to target profit and loss areas within this database. Using these metrics, I was able to create visuals to show the client which areas needed improvement

## Key Findings

* Regional Profit Maker: United States Western Region

* Profit Maker in Western Region by Subcategory: Accessories and Appliances

* Regional Loss Maker: United States Central Region

* Loss Maker in Central Region by Subcategory: Appliances ad Furnishings

* Top 3 Subcategories Generating Profit : Accessories, Copiers, Appliances

* Superstore must stop selling: Tables

* Top 3 States for Advertising: Indiana, Vermont, Washington

 ## Recommendations

 * In order to avoid bankruptcy I recommend 'Superstore' to cease sales on furnishings and appliances in the central region.

 * In order to decrease loss I recommend reserving advertising budget in the months, May, June, and July. These 3 months are the least profitable in the United States.

 * Implement a customer service line or service technician to trouble shoot issues before the customer must return the product.
